# PyMongoDB
A project to store details of patients on MongoDB using Python


ABSTRACT :-
The project will allows hospital receptionist to perform various operations like insertion of patient details, deletion of patient details, updating the patient details, displaying all patient details, finding a particular patient details, sorting patient details based on their names. The insert operation would include inputting all the required data about the patients. The delete operation is performed by the receptionist when a particular patient details is no longer required. The update operation performs updation of a particular patient details when any updating is required. Display operation is used to read out all patient details. Find operation can be used by receptionist to find a particular patient details. Sort operation can be used to sort patient details in particular order.

INTRODUCTION

The project “Hospital management” is based upon the implementation of a real world Hospital Management to hold the details of patients. It contains the various operations like adding, deleting, updating, displaying, finding and sorting of patient details.
1.1 MOTIVATION
The motive of this project is to implement a real world problem into a miniature model. Hospital Management before were implemented on written form of recording data, which now has been evolved into recording data on computers in an easy and simplified manner. So this project implements a miniature model of the hospitals with all the necessary and basic modules. This essentially gives many advantages over the old - school written way of storing data.
1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT
This project’s objective is to create a miniature model of the software used in Health Centre Management to perform their task like recording Patient details. The concepts used to implement this project are databases and python.
1.3 OBJECTIVES
1. Implementing a real world Hospital Patient details management.
2. Recording Patients information.
3. Recording details and updating inventory of new or existing records.
4. Flexible Hospital management.

1.4 ADVANTAGES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM:
1.  All the activities of the Hospital are automated.
2. Details of the patient is maintained by the system.
3. Allows fast access to data.
4. Patient database is maintained which will be helpful for authentication

CONCLUSION :-

With the help of this project we were able to learn many new things and update our knowledge on programming. We were successful in changing the method of storing the details related to the patient details by making it automated. All the activities happening are automated. Patient details is maintained by the system. Due to computerization of all the data all operations become easy and time saving. Due to the fast access of the data we can view the details of any particular patient or information when ever needed, we can even update any particular detail of a patient as per our requirements, since all data are stored in a file there is a backup of data hence the chances of losing the data is minimized. The calculation of the number of patients admitted to Hospital is made easy which would otherwise be a very tedious method.
